A Fun Python Virtual Assistant

The purpose of this project was to learn about some new libraries in Python, especially one that offers text to speech.

This virtual assistant does the following:
1. Use the Voice Engine to repeat a word, phrase, or series of phrases.
2. Tell us a programming joke.
3. Read a summary of a chosen subject from Wikipedia.
4. Tell us the weather in Orlando, FL (or any city we specify in the code).
5. Tell us a random funny story.
6. Read us a story about Darth Plagueis the Wise from Star Wars.
7. Suggest a random movie for us to watch from the IMDB Top 250
